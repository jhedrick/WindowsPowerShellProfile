# Powershell Profile

Your powershell profile is stored in `$profile` environment variable. You can read this variable in powershell.

The purpose of this file should be as simple as 

1. cloning this repository into a Download location (or unzipping it), 
2. backing up your existing profile in the directory $profile is stored in (should if you already use powershell), and
3. overwriting the primary profile, including extra scripts and modules that enable the desired functionality.
